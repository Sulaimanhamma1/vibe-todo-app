# Todo List App (Vibe Coding Project)

## Project Description
This project is a simple and fully functional Todo List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to manage daily tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.  
All tasks are stored persistently using the browser’s localStorage, so data is preserved after page reloads.

The project was developed using Bolt.new (StackBlitz) as a vibe coding tool, focusing on intent-driven and AI-assisted development.
