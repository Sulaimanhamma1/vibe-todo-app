## Tool Selection Justification

I chose Bolt.new (by StackBlitz) as the vibe coding tool for this project because it provides an AI-assisted development environment that focuses on intent-driven coding rather than manual setup. The tool allows developers to quickly scaffold and build complete applications using natural language guidance, which made it ideal for an academic project focused on understanding vibe coding concepts.

Another reason for choosing Bolt.new was its browser-based environment and instant preview feature. This removed the need for local configuration and allowed rapid testing and iteration. Since the Todo List application is a JavaScript-based project, Bolt.new’s strong support for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript made it a practical and efficient choice.

## Development Process

The development process began by selecting a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript template in Bolt.new. This provided a simple foundation on which core functionality could be built. I then incrementally added features such as task creation, deletion, editing, completion toggling, and data persistence using the browser’s localStorage API.

Throughout development, I interacted with the AI by describing desired behaviors rather than specific code instructions. Prompts such as implementing task persistence or improving UI layout were particularly effective. This approach allowed the AI to generate structured solutions instead of isolated code snippets.

The project required several iterations to reach a fully functional and clean state. Initial iterations focused on making the application work correctly, while later iterations refined the code structure, improved readability, and enhanced the user interface. Each iteration brought the project closer to a polished final result.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the main challenges encountered was ensuring that task data persisted correctly after page reloads. Early versions of the application displayed tasks correctly but did not always save changes reliably. The AI helped identify where localStorage updates were missing, after which manual adjustments were made to ensure data was saved after every modification.

Another challenge was improving the visual appearance of the application. While the initial version was functional, it looked too plain. The AI provided basic styling suggestions, but additional manual CSS refinements were necessary to improve spacing, layout, and visual hierarchy while keeping the design simple and academic.

In some cases, the AI-generated code needed manual correction to better align with project requirements and coding best practices. This highlighted the importance of reviewing and understanding AI-generated output rather than relying on it without verification.

## Reflection

One surprising aspect of vibe coding was how much it shifted focus from syntax to functionality. Instead of thinking primarily about how to write each line of code, I focused more on what the application should do and how users would interact with it. This made development feel more collaborative and goal-oriented.

Vibe coding significantly improved my workflow by reducing setup time and accelerating experimentation. However, it also required careful oversight to ensure correctness and maintain code quality. Human judgment remained essential throughout the process.

I would use this tool for future projects, especially for prototyping and small-to-medium applications. In the future, vibe coding technologies may lower barriers to entry in software development and allow developers to focus more on problem-solving, design, and innovation rather than repetitive implementation tasks.
